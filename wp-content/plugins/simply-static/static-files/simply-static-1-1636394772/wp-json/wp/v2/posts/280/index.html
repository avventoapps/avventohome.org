He could choose to not make man after foreseeing this\ntragedy yet this would be against Himself; The God of liberty. By principle,\nwhen He thinks of something good, His thought or expression (word) is a power\nto its existence. So humanity was not too far after Satan\u2019s dismissal from\nheaven created on a young new earth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately Satan saw an opportunity of usurping the new\nworld (earth), his only entrance being through those to whom God had placed the\ncare and governance of the earth. Disguisedly he tempted Eve and through her\nwas successful in making Adam also sin against God in eating the forbidden tree\nthat was of the knowledge of good and evil. Having tapped into this mixture,\nthe world soon increasingly became marred with sin; hate, violence, crime and\nany form of evil started their growth to chock the good with which God had\nformed this universe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jesus Christ with God before the creation foresaw this\nterrible emergency, they covenanted to go at length of love to save us when\nthat happened, so Jesus came to this evil world leaving behind all glory and a\nthrone, He came as one of us, divinity had taken on humanity such a risk of\nlove. If Jesus\u2019s efforts to save us failed in any way, we were hopeless. Our earth\nwould forever be the territory of the devil, a laboratory of all sorts of evil\nand pain. But Jesus determined to depend on His father never failed His\nmission. That\u2019s why we Christians today worship Him in the newness of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of us has such a perfect expression of love to help our fallen friends and enemies come to God and be blessed also with such new life as we hope for a final recreation where it will all be good and no mixture with evil. Do you know that all forms to save others will always yield to restoring such ones, yet any failure is equivalent to Jesus\u2019 mission failing!!! Think about it you who believes now, if Jesus in his mission on earth had failed, would you be here blessing others through His goodness that touches you every moment and lets you do good! No, we would have been lost. Similarly if we fail in reaching out to a soul, that soul will never become good and thus the world will tend to more evil ripening it to its final destruction. God help us to in His strength and guidance do all it takes to save that one soul that Jesus came to seek and restore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is indeed; love divine all loves excelling, best love\nlanguage ever; risking a soul for another soul. o love that will not let me go.\nTo learn more about this greater love, read the book the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ellenwhite.info\/books\/books-by-egw-da.htm\">Desire of Ages<\/a>\nand you will learn how to make love to God and others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John 15:13 \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d Prior to creating man, God in his infinite wisdom foresaw Satan\u2019s temptation that would result into the fall of Adam and<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"spay_email":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/280"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=280"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/280\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":290,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/280\/revisions\/290"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=280"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=280"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/avventohome.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=280"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
